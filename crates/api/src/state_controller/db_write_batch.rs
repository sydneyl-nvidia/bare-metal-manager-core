/// A DbWriteBatch exists to allow state controllers to enqueue write operations until the end of
/// processing, so that they don't need to hold a database connection open across long-running work.
/// If the state handler returns an error, the write operations are discarded, similarly to how a
/// transaction is rolled back. If a state handler returns successfully, the write operations are
/// all done at once inside a transaction before committing.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// You can pass a FnOnce closure that accepts a transaction, that will be called when your state handler is successful. For example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let write_batch = DbWriteBatch::new();
/// write_batch.push(move |txn| async move {
///     db::machine::find_by_ip(txn, &Ipv4Addr::new(17, 0, 0, 1)).await
/// }.boxed());
///
/// // Later the controller will do:
/// write_batch.apply_all(&mut txn);
/// ```
///
/// You can also implement [`WriteOp`] manually for any given type, allowing write operations to be
/// reused.
